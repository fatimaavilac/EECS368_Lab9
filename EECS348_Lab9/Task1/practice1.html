	<p>In my sophomore year, I studied abroad in South Korea and lived in Seoul for 5 months. It was an
	incredible experience that I am very happy to have had. One of the things I did there was I
	played for the school's soccer club. Through that club, I met a lot of friends who I sometimes
	still talk to and it was also how I got to explore the city a lot.<br>
	Here is a picture of my friends Harriet, Yebin, Hoyeon, and Goeun and I coming home on a bus
	after a soccer practice.</p>
